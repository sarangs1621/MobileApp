/**
 * Publish-with-notification COMPOSITION (M10 Step 5, ADR-018 §3) — the application
 * seam that couples a frozen publish to its notification emit. This lives in the
 * BUSINESS layer (not transport): the router calls exactly ONE of these and stays
 * thin. The existing publish services are UNTOUCHED — each composer merely calls
 * the frozen service, then, once it has committed, fires the best-effort emit.
 * Notifications therefore never fire before commit; a legitimate re-publish
 * (reopen, correction) composes again by design.
 *
 * This is the canonical pattern for future milestones adding notifications to an
 * existing action: add an `emit*` + a `*AndNotify` composer here, repoint the
 * router — never inline the orchestration in transport, never edit the frozen
 * service.
