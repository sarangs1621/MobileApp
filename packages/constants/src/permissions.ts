 * Project-wide permission catalog. Authorization maps Role → Permission(s) →
 * (scope) → business service — code checks a PERMISSION, never a hard-coded role
 * string. Roles are fixed; permissions are centralized here for readability,
 * testing, and extensibility. Evaluators live in `@repo/core` (pure `can()`).
 *
 * A permission names a CAPABILITY (`resource:action[:scope]`). Row/ownership
 * SCOPE (own division / own child / self) is enforced separately in the service
 * layer (Dev PRD §4.4, ADR-002) — a permission grants the ability; scope narrows
 * the target.
 *
 * M1 (auth) defines only the cross-cutting auth/admin permissions below, derived
 * from the RBAC matrix (Dev PRD §5). Feature permissions (attendance, marks,
 * homework, fees, …) are added by their own milestones — never invented here.
