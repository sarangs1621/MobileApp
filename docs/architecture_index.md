# Architecture Index — feature → ADR map

Use this to locate the correct ADR without opening every ADR.
It does **not** duplicate ADR content; open an ADR only when its decision is directly relevant.
All ADRs live in `docs/architecture/`.

## By feature

**Authentication / sessions / profiles**
- ADR-001 — Authentication via Supabase Auth
- ADR-002 — Single tRPC API with application-enforced authorization
- ADR-007 — Audit log (role/user/status mutations)

**Students / enrollment**
- ADR-010 — Student ↔ Enrollment model (year-bound membership; promotion/transfer/retention)
- ADR-003 — Repositories as the data-access boundary
- ADR-007 — Audit log (enrollment mutations)

**Attendance / leave / corrections / holidays**
- ADR-011 — Attendance data ownership (Session/Record on Enrollment; leave, corrections, working-day calendar)
- ADR-010 — Enrollment is the join point (attendance keys to Enrollment, not Student)

## Cross-cutting (apply to every feature — already condensed in `.claude/project_rules.md`; open only for full rationale)

- ADR-002 — API layer + authorization model (permission + scope in the business layer)
- ADR-003 — Repository pattern (all data access)
- ADR-008 — Single-tenant now, SaaS-ready later (`schoolId` on every table)
