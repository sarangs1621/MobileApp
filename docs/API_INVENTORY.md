# API Inventory — School Management Portal

Complete catalog of the tRPC surface (expands Dev PRD §7), plus scheduled jobs, webhooks, HTTP routes, and the notification event matrix. Conventions per `API_CONVENTIONS.md`. Q = query, M = mutation. **Audit** = writes `AuditLog` in-transaction. **Notif** = fires `NotificationService`. Permissions reference `PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md`.

## system (M0/M1 — implemented)

| Procedure | T | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system.live` | Q | public | liveness; no deps |
| `system.ready` | Q | public | readiness; DB via api→business→db |

## auth (M1 — implemented)

Gates: **onboarding** = authenticated, INVITED or ACTIVE (DISABLED rejected); **protected** = authenticated + ACTIVE only. Fine-grained permission is then enforced in the business service (`assertCan`).

| Procedure | T | Gate | Permission | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `auth.me` | Q | onboarding | – | – | returns the `Principal` (userId/schoolId/role/status) |
| `auth.registerProfile` | M | onboarding | – | ✓ `USER_ACTIVATED` | idempotent first-sign-in activation INVITED→ACTIVE; re-sign-in only touches `lastLoginAt` (not re-audited) |
| `auth.updateProfile` | M | protected | `profile:update:self` | – | own non-credential fields (M1: locale) |
| `auth.setRole` | M | protected | `user:set_role` | ✓ | |
| `auth.disableUser` | M | protected | `user:disable` | ✓ | self-disable rejected (FORBIDDEN) |
| `auth.enableUser` | M | protected | `user:disable` | ✓ | re-enable → ACTIVE |

Logout/refresh are client-side Supabase session operations (`@repo/auth` helpers), not procedures.

## academic structure (M2 — implemented)

Six flat routers (naming per M2 kickoff brief: **Class/Section**, not the older
ClassLevel/Division draft). All procedures run on the **protected** gate
(authenticated + ACTIVE); the business service then enforces the permission.
Reads need `academic:read` (SUPER_ADMIN, OFFICE_ADMIN, TEACHER); mutations need
`academic:manage` (SUPER_ADMIN, OFFICE_ADMIN). Parents have no access. Every
mutation writes `AuditLog` in the same transaction. Lists return bounded full
arrays (single-tenant admin data) — cursor pagination arrives with unbounded data.

| Procedure | T | Permission | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `academicYear.list/get` | Q | `academic:read` | – | |
| `academicYear.create/update` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | name unique/school; start<end; ≤1 ACTIVE/school |
| `academicYear.delete` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | cascades its terms (DB Cascade) |
| `academicTerm.list` | Q | `academic:read` | – | by `academicYearId` |
| `academicTerm.get` | Q | `academic:read` | – | |
| `academicTerm.create/update` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | name unique/year; start<end; no overlap (incl. boundary) |
| `academicTerm.delete` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | |
| `class.list/get` | Q | `academic:read` | – | ordered by `sortOrder` |
| `class.create/update` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | name unique/school |
| `class.delete` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | blocked while sections exist |
| `section.list` | Q | `academic:read` | – | by `classId` |
| `section.get` | Q | `academic:read` | – | |
| `section.create/update` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | name unique/class |
| `section.delete` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | blocked while assignments exist |
| `subject.list/get` | Q | `academic:read` | – | school-wide catalog |
| `subject.create/update` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | name unique/school |
| `subject.delete` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | blocked while assignments exist |
| `teacherAssignment.list` | Q | `academic:read` | – | filters teacher/subject/section; a TEACHER is always scoped to own rows |
| `teacherAssignment.get` | Q | `academic:read` | – | teacher may read only own (scope rule) |
| `teacherAssignment.create` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | assignee must be ACTIVE TEACHER in school; no duplicate (teacher, subject, section) |
| `teacherAssignment.delete` | M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | assignments are immutable — no update |

## students / guardians / staff (M3 — planned)

| Procedure | T | Permission | Audit | Notif | Pagination |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `students.list` | Q | `student:read` | – | – | cursor (search/filter by class/division/status) |
| `students.get` | Q | `student:read` | – | – | – |

| `guardians.create` / `linkToStudent` / `invite` | M | `guardian:*` | ✓ | invite → SMS/notification | |
| `guardians.list` | Q | `student:read` | – | – | cursor |
| `staff.create` / `update` / `assign` | M | `staff:*` | ✓ | – | assign = TeacherAssignment incl. isClassTeacher |

## calendar / settings / enrollment (M3+ — planned)

Older draft rows (pre-M2-kickoff naming). `setCurrent` was subsumed by
`academicYear.update { status }` in the implemented surface above; holidays,
settings, class-subject mapping, and the class-teacher flag are future work.

| Procedure | T | Permission | Audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `academic.holidays.*` (list/create/delete) | Q/M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | school calendar (Dev PRD §8.19); optional class scope |

| `classSubjects.*` (class↔subject mapping) | Q/M | `academic:manage` | ✓ | with class-teacher flag on assignments |
| `enrollment.enroll` / `transfer` / `drop` | M | `enrollment:*` | ✓ | |
| `enrollment.list` | Q | `student:read` | – | offset OK (bounded roster) |

`markBulk` upserts on `[enrollmentId, date, period]` — idempotent, safe for offline replay.

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | liveness (implemented) |
| `GET /api/ready` | readiness (implemented) |
| `POST /api/webhooks/razorpay` | `fees` — HMAC-verified, idempotent by `razorpayOrderId`; updates Payment/Invoice + audit |
