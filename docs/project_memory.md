## Current Milestone

**M6 — Homework & Assignment Management** (scope = Homework + HomeworkAttachment +
HomeworkSubmission (per **Enrollment**, never Student) + SubmissionAttachment +
HomeworkFeedback; ADR-013 extends ADR-010/011/012 + ADR-004 storage. Lifecycles:
homework `DRAFT→PUBLISHED→CLOSED` (audited reopen), submission
`SUBMITTED→RETURNED→REVIEWED` (in-place resubmit, attempt counter). Parents submit
for children — no student login. **Brief overrides PRD decision #13:** submissions
are core, not distribution-only, no `homework-uploads` flag). **Numbering:** M6
here = PRD-planned homework milestone, shifted by the M5 renumbering.

## Current Step

**M6 Step 3 (Relationships) COMPLETE — STOPPED awaiting approval before Step 4
(RLS).** Step 2 shipped migration `20260710000000_homework_management` (5 models,
2 enums, 8 CHECKs, unique (homework, enrollment); no drift; 22/22 constraint
proofs). Step 3 live-verified the graph via rollback-safe probes (11/11 PASS,
zero rows persisted): 17/17 FK delete rules exact (no SetNull by design),
promotion + in-place transfer preserve submission history, cascade precisely
scoped, actors durable, guarded-transition primitives work; diagram updated.
M6 kickoff was read as implicit approval of M5 → M3/M4/M5 frozen.

## Completed

- ✓ **M0** — Foundation (Turborepo, 12 packages, web+mobile shells, CI) — **FROZEN**
- ✓ M1 Step 1 — Requirements analysis
- ✓ M1 Step 2 — Auth DB design (User, UserStatus, DeviceToken, AuditLog, School enums) + init migration
- ✓ M1 Step 3 — Authorization design (permission + scope, `ScopeRule` extension point)
- ✓ M1 Step 4 — Auth architecture (Supabase clients, JWT verify, context→Principal, activation)
- ✓ M1 Step 5 — API layer (`auth.me`, `auth.registerProfile`)
- ✓ M1 Step 6 — Business layer (`updateProfile`, `setRole`, `disableUser`, `enableUser` + audit-in-tx)
- ✓ M1 Step 7 — Mobile auth (splash/gate/login/OTP/session/logout/role shell)
- ✓ M1 Step 8 — Web auth (login/forgot/OTP/protected layout/middleware/logout/dashboard)
- ✓ Workflow — Intelligent context loading system (`.claude/START_HERE.md` router + `docs/architecture_index.md`; docs only, no code changed)
- ✓ M1 Step 9 — Security review (`docs/SECURITY_REVIEW_M1.md`): fixed OTP `shouldCreateUser:false` (SMS-pumping/user-creation hole) + added web security headers; Supabase dashboard config checklist pending provisioning
- ✓ M1 Step 10 — Tests: 7 suites / 80 tests (auth 22, business 20, api 14, core 8, web 7, validation 6, utils 3). **Caught+fixed critical bug:** `mapDomainErrors` (`packages/api/src/trpc.ts`) was dead code — tRPC v11 `next()` returns a result, never throws — so business `DomainError`s surfaced as 500s; now remaps `error.cause` to typed codes (frozen-module amendment, allowed as critical bug)
- ✓ M1 Step 11 — Documentation: `API_INVENTORY.md` auth section (implemented, gates, 6 procedures), `API_CONVENTIONS.md` §6 error-mapping nuance, `features/authentication.md` + status/milestone docs synced; no new ADR
- ✓ **M1 approved & frozen** (2026-07-05)
- ✓ **M1.5 — Infrastructure Provisioning**: live Supabase project (`wupcsvbyrknfuuskzuzp`) wired + migrated; `@repo/auth` admin module; bootstrap/provision/verify ops scripts (`packages/business/scripts`); auth security config applied via Management API (signups off, test OTP, OTP 600s, pw ≥10, URLs); **11/11 live auth checks passed** (OTP, email login, activation, session restore, refresh, logout, provisioning, signup-disabled); web build + expo android bundle with real env; `docs/RUNBOOK_SUPABASE_SETUP.md` + `docs/milestones/M1.5-infrastructure.md`

- ✓ **M2 Steps 1–5** (2026-07-05) — requirements analysis; DB schema + migration
  (6 models, live-probed constraints); RLS policies (`20260705010000_academic_rls`);
  6 business services (permission+scope gated, audited in-tx); 6 thin API routers
  + Zod inputs (`istDateSchema`)
- ✓ **M2 Step 6** — mobile read-only academic screens (years/classes/subjects/
  assignments) + role-aware Home links
- ✓ **M2 Step 7** — web CRUD `/academic/*` (years+terms, classes+sections,
  subjects, assignments) with search/pagination/filters/dialogs; manage-gated UI
- ✓ **M2 Step 8** — tests: 17 files / 136 total (business 50, auth 32, api 25,
  validation 11, core 8, web 7, utils 3); typecheck+lint 14/14; web prod build
  with real env validation
- ✓ **M2 Steps 9–10** — docs synced (API_INVENTORY rewritten to implemented
  surface, feature + status docs added) + deliverables report → awaiting approval

- ✓ **M2 approved & frozen** (2026-07-05)
- ✓ **M3 Steps 1–5** (2026-07-05, commit `741dca1`) — ADR-010 (Student identity
  vs Enrollment placement) + requirements; DB schema + migration
  `20260705030000_people_management` (Student/StudentDocument/Parent/
  StudentParent/Staff/Enrollment, partial uniques, CHECKs); relationships
  (Restrict on placement history, Cascade docs/links, SetNull parent login);
  RLS `20260705040000_people_rls` (admin ALL, teacher own-section, parent
  own-child, self rows); 5 business services + shared row-scope helpers,
  audited in-tx; PERMISSIONS split `*:read`/`*:manage` per people entity
- ✓ **M3 Step 6** (`9fded51`) — 5 thin routers (`student/parent/teacherProfile/
  enrollment/studentDocument`) + Zod inputs; `StudentListFilter` widened for
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- ✓ **M3 Step 7** (`e5b7d28`) — mobile read-only people screens (students,
  student profile w/ enrollment history + guardians, parents, teacher profiles);
  permission-gated Home links
- ✓ **M3 Step 8** (`6f17532`) — web `/people/*` full CRUD (students + detail
  with enroll/transfer/promote/withdraw, guardian links, documents; parents;
  teacher profiles); **ADR-004 storage end-to-end**: business `StoragePort`
  mint services (authz before URL), API `storageProcedure` +
  `uploadUrl/downloadUrl`, web service-role adapter + `uploadToSignedUrl`;
  private `student-documents` bucket documented (runbook §3b, provisioning
  pending)
- ✓ **M3 Step 9** (`d1929eb`) — +77 tests (business 53: identity uniqueness,
  row scopes, full ADR-010 lifecycle incl. invalid transfer/promotion, guardian
  links, document visibility + mint authz; api 15; validation 9). Totals:
  **20 files / 213 tests**; typecheck+lint 14/14; web build + mobile export ✓
- ✓ **M3 Step 10** — docs synced (API_INVENTORY people section,
  `features/people-management.md`, status, milestone, memory); no new ADR
  (ADR-010 + ADR-004 cover the decisions)

- ✓ **M4 Steps 1–10 (Attendance, ADR-011)** — **Step 1** ADR-011 (Session/Record
  on Enrollment; audit actors not owner; immutable corrections; leave-as-default;
  DRAFT→SUBMITTED→LOCKED; working-day calendar) + PERMISSIONS_MATRIX. **2–4**
  migrations `20260707000000_attendance_management` (5 models/6 enums, two
  partial-unique register indexes, empirically drift-checked) + relationships
  (attendance Restrict→Enrollment) + `20260707010000_attendance_rls`. **5** 4
  services (attendance/leave/correction/holiday) — B3 staff-actor, leave biases
  roster default only, compute-on-read summary. **6** 4 thin routers + Zod. **7**
  mobile teacher mark/history/corrections + parent attendance/calendar/leave
  (added `attendance.findSession`, `attendanceCorrection.listMine`, `Record.date`).
  **8** web `/attendance/*` dashboard (bulk mark, filters, date picker, CSV,
  approval queues, holidays; added `leave.listPending` + enriched correction
  queue). **9** 392 tests incl. real Promise.all concurrency + state-machine +
  authorization matrices; **concurrency hardening (real defect):** guarded
  conditional transitions on submit/lock + correction approval. **10** docs.

- ✓ **M5 Steps 1–10 (Examination & Assessment, ADR-012)** — **Step 1** ADR-012
  (Exam→Assessment→ExamSection→Mark on Enrollment; two grains lock-per-register /
  publish-per-exam; grade snapshots; derived ownership; naming diverges from PRD)
  + 15 refinements. **2–4** migrations `20260709000000_examination_assessment` (5
  models + 2 enums, GradeBand non-overlap `EXCLUDE`, 15 constraint proofs) +
  relationships (Cascade chain + R5 published-data deletion guard, built early) +
  `20260709010000_exam_rls` (12/12 read + 15/15 write isolation proven). **5** 5
  services + central `@repo/core/grade`; race-safe register `ensure` (real race
  hardened); lock snapshots grade in-tx. **6** 4 thin routers (21 procedures) +
  Zod. **7** mobile teacher mark-entry + parent results (added `mark.markable` +
  DTO name enrichment). **8** web `/exams/*` admin console (dashboard, assessment
  CRUD, marks grid, lock/unlock, publish with R3 count, grade scales; added
  `exam.get` + `exam.registers`). **9** +60 tests → business 207 / api 266 /
  validation 50 (35/35 turbo tasks); authorization matrix + `listExamRegisters`
  mutation-checked; no defects. **10** docs.

- ✓ **M1 RLS hardening** (security-fix exception, 2026-07-05): M1 auth tables shipped with no RLS. Migration `20260705020000_m1_rls_hardening` enables RLS (not FORCE) on School/User/DeviceToken/AuditLog with read-only policies (`user_read_self` + `is_admin()` reads; owner-only device tokens; admin-only School/AuditLog) — stops parent/teacher user enumeration; no write policies (writes stay service_role); anon denied. Defense-in-depth only. **Blocking pre-apply gate:** confirm live Prisma role bypasses RLS before applying or auth locks out (see `docs/RLS_POLICIES.md`). All 80 tests still green.

## Frozen Modules (read-only — see workflow.md)

- M0 scaffold + tooling + CI
- Auth DB models (`packages/db`), Authorization (`packages/core` + `packages/business/authorization`)
- Business auth services (`packages/business/{auth,services}`), API auth router (`packages/api`)
- Mobile auth (`apps/mobile/src/{app,lib,stores,providers}`), Web auth (`apps/web` auth routes + middleware + `src/lib/supabase`)
- M2 academic structure (schema/migrations, `services/academic`, academic routers, `/academic/*` web, mobile academic screens)
- M3 people management (schema/migrations, `services/people`, people routers, `/people/*` web, mobile people screens) — frozen at M6 kickoff (implicit M5 approval)
- M4 attendance (schema/migrations, `services/attendance`, attendance/leave/correction/holiday routers, `/attendance/*` web, mobile attendance screens) — frozen at M6 kickoff
- M5 examination (schema/migrations `2026070900/0100`, `services/exam`, `@repo/core/grade`, exam/assessment/mark/gradeScale routers, `/exams/*` web, mobile exam screens) — frozen at M6 kickoff

> Frozen = amend only for a critical bug, a security fix (Step 9 may amend), or explicit user approval.

## Architecture Rules (authoritative summary — see .claude/project_rules.md)

- Business logic only in `packages/business` services; **routers stay thin** (validate → authorize → delegate).
- **Repositories contain no authorization**; only `packages/db` imports `@prisma/client`.
- **`api` never imports `db`; `apps` never import `db`/`business`** (use `@repo/api`).
- **Authorization = permission (`assertCan`) + scope (`assertScope`) in the business layer**, on the DB-built `Principal`. No role from JWT/client. No transport role gate.
- **Role/schoolId/status come only from the DB `User` profile.**
- Sensitive mutations write an `AuditLog` row in the same transaction.
- RLS is defense-in-depth (Prisma bypasses it); IST everywhere; add-ons behind `FeatureFlag`.

## Dependency Rules (package boundaries)

`core` pure (types/constants/utils only) · `db` = only Prisma consumer · `business` composes db+core+notifications · `api` → business (not db) · `apps` → api/ui/i18n (not db/business). Enforced by ESLint `no-restricted-imports`.

## Current Status

M0/M1/M1.5/M2 **approved & frozen**; M3 People + M4 Attendance complete (awaiting
approval). **M5 Examination & Assessment complete (Steps 1–10), awaiting
approval:** `Exam → Assessment → ExamSection (register) → Mark` on Enrollment
(ADR-012 — results survive promotion), forward-only `DRAFT→SUBMITTED→LOCKED` lock
per register + publish per exam (parents never see a partial), central grade
compute **snapshotted at lock** (GradeScale edits never mutate history),
configurable grade scales, GPA from snapshots. Ownership derives from
TeacherAssignment (admins bypass); row scope + RLS defense-in-depth (12/12 read +
15/15 write proven). Teacher mobile mark-entry + parent results; web `/exams/*`
admin console (dashboard, assessment CRUD, marks grid, lock/unlock, publish with
R3 count, grade-scale management, CSV). Race-safe register create (real race
hardened); guarded transitions. Verified **typecheck ✓, lint ✓, 35/35 turbo
tasks** (business 207, api 266, validation 50); mobile ios export ✓ (Step 7).

## Known Blockers / Notes

- **Real SMS provider pending:** Twilio creds are placeholders; only the test OTP number (`+919999900001`) works. Provider choice + India DLT needed before parent go-live.
- **Rotate credentials before real data:** service-role key + DB password (+ seed admin password) were shared during setup; HIBP protection needs the Pro plan; custom SMTP before production. See M1.5 doc "Deferred".
- **Source of truth is now Dev PRD v1.3** (merged from other contributors; reconciles milestone numbering + authz model to this code).
- **Config artifacts to resolve:** a stray root `package-lock.json` (npm) and root `tsconfig.json` were merged in — conflict with the pnpm/Turborepo setup; cleanup pending user decision.

## Next Task

**STOPPED — M6 Step 1 (Requirements Analysis / ADR-013) reported; waiting for user
approval before Step 2 (DB design).** Surfaced for sign-off: brief overrides PRD
distribution-only homework (#13); OA gets `homework:manage`; content frozen at
publish (dueDate extend-only); no resubmit after REVIEWED; new private
`homework-files` bucket (user provisions before live uploads). Prior open
sign-offs still stand: **holiday = hard block in M4** (ADR-011 §9); before live
document uploads create the private `student-documents` bucket (runbook §3b).
