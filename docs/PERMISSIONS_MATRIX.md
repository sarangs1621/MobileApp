# Permissions Matrix — School Management Portal

The full authorization catalog: every **permission** (`resource:action[:scope]`), which **role** holds it, and which **scope rule** narrows it. Extends Dev PRD §5 and the M1 implementation (`packages/constants/permissions.ts`, `packages/business/authorization.ts`) to all milestones. All formerly-PROPOSED rows were **adopted in Dev PRD v1.3** (see REVIEW_FINDINGS resolution status); rows noting a pending client [CONFIRM] keep that tag until answered.

**Model (ADR-002, M1 refinement):** transport authenticates (`protectedProcedure` → `Principal { userId, schoolId, role, status }` from the DB, never the JWT). The business service then checks **permission** (`assertCan(principal, PERMISSION)`) and **scope** (`assertScope(rule, principal, resourceFacts)`). There is no transport role gate.

## Scope rules (`ScopeRule` predicates)

| Rule | Grants access when… | Facts loaded by service |
|---|---|---|
| `self` | resource is the principal's own account/profile | — |
| `ownDivision` | teacher has a `TeacherAssignment` for the division | assignments |
| `ownSubject` | teacher's assignment covers the `classSubjectId` | assignments |
| `classTeacher` | principal is the section's `ClassTeacherAssignment` teacher for the year (M6.5, ADR-015 — **not** a `TeacherAssignment.isClassTeacher` flag, which was never built) | class-teacher assignment |
| `ownChild` | `GuardianStudent` links guardian → student | guardian links |
| `school` | resource's `schoolId` == principal's (always also enforced by repositories) | — |
| `any` | no narrowing (super admin) | — |

## Core permissions

SA = Super Admin, OA = Office Admin, T = Teacher, P = Parent, AC = Accountant. Cell shows the **scope rule** applied; `–` = not granted.

### Identity & users (M1)

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `profile:read:self` / `profile:update:self` | self | self | self | self | self |
| `user:read` | any | – | – | – | – |
| `user:invite` | any | – | – | – | – |
| `user:set_role` | any | – | – | – | – |
| `user:disable` | any | – | – | – | – |
| `audit:read` | any | – | – | – | – |

### People & import (M2)

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `student:create` / `student:update` / `student:archive` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `student:read` | any | school | ownDivision — **adopted v1.3** (Dev PRD §5 "View student records") | ownChild | – |
| `guardian:create` / `guardian:link` / `guardian:invite` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `staff:create` / `staff:update` / `staff:assign` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `import:run` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `academic:manage` (years, classes, divisions, subjects, mappings, assignments, **holidays, school settings** — v1.3) | any | school | – | – | – |
| `enrollment:enroll` / `enrollment:transfer` / `enrollment:drop` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `enrollment:promote_bulk` | any | – | – | – | – |

### Class teacher management (M6.5, ADR-015 · implemented)

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `classTeacher.assign` / `.replace` / `.remove` → `academic:manage` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `classTeacher.get` → `academic:read` | any | school | school | – | – |

- The class teacher of a `(academicYear × section)` is the dedicated `ClassTeacherAssignment` (ADR-015) — **one row per slot**; a replacement is an **in-place update** (never a 2nd row), audited `CLASS_TEACHER_REPLACE`. `teacherId → User`; `createdByStaffId → Staff` (B3 actor — the assigning admin needs a `Staff` row).
- No new permission: management reuses `academic:manage` (its remit already covers "assignments"), reads reuse `academic:read`. RLS: admin ALL, teacher SELECT own (`teacherId = auth.uid()`), parent/anon none.
- Consumed by report cards (M7/ADR-014) via the `assertClassTeacherOfEnrollment` scope predicate — only the assigned class teacher may author teacher remarks.

### Attendance (M4 — ADR-011)

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `attendance:mark` | any | school | ownDivision | – | – |
| `attendance:read` | any | school | ownDivision | ownChild | – |
| `attendance:correct:submit` | any | school | ownDivision | – | – |
| `attendance:correct:decide` | any | school | classTeacher | – | – |

- Session ownership is **derived from `TeacherAssignment`**, not stored on the session (ADR-011 §3). DAILY = any assignment to the section; SUBJECT = matching `(subject, section)` assignment.
- Note B3: marking + correction actors need a `Staff` row (session `createdBy/submittedBy/lockedBy`, correction `requestedBy/decidedBy` — ADR-011 §4) — provisioning must guarantee one for every SA/OA/T user.
- Holidays are managed under `academic:manage` (working-day calendar, ADR-011 §9).

### Exams & marks (M5, ADR-012 · implemented)

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exam:manage` (create/update/delete exams + assessments + grade scales; lock/unlock registers; publish) | any | school | – | – | – |
| `marks:enter` (save + submit a register) | any | school | ownSubject×Section (owns via `TeacherAssignment`; register lock is admin-only) | – | – |
| `marks:read` (marks/grades/GPA) | any | school | ownSection | ownChild — **published + LOCKED only** (never a partial/in-flight result) | – |

- Ownership is **derived from `TeacherAssignment(teacher, subject, section)`**, never stored (ADR-012 §9); admins bypass scope. Mark/register actors are a **`Staff` row** (B3 — via `Staff.userId`), same as attendance.
- Two grains: a register **locks** per `ExamSection` (admin), an exam **publishes** per `Exam` (admin) — publish exposes all LOCKED sections at once; grade/percentage is **snapshotted at lock** and GradeScale edits never mutate history.
- OA/SA hold `marks:enter`/`marks:read` school-wide but have no `TeacherAssignment`, so day-to-day entry is teacher-driven (mobile); admins enter/oversee via the web console (find-or-create register).
- **Not built in M5** (later milestones): `reportcard:generate`/`reportcard:read` (report-card PDFs, ADR-009), publish-notify (no notifications in M5), CGPA-across-years.

### Homework & Assignment Management (M6, ADR-013 — implemented)

Built as **M6** (see `docs/milestones/M6.md`). The M6 brief **overrode the PRD's
distribution-only plan** (decision-#13): parent submissions, uploads, teacher review,
and feedback are **core** (no `homework-uploads` flag). Homework is **always
subject-bound**, so teacher scope is uniformly `ownSubject×Section` (derived from
`TeacherAssignment`) — there is no division-only variant. Deviations from the
PRD-planned rows are decided in ADR-013 §11 (OA gets `homework:manage`; `submission:
submit` is parent-only). Row/ownership scope is enforced in the service; RLS is
defense-in-depth (28/28 isolation proven).

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `homework:manage` (create/edit/publish/close/reopen/delete + teacher attachments) | any | school | ownSubject×Section | – | – |
| `homework:read` | any | school | ownSubject×Section | ownChild (PUBLISHED/CLOSED, §10 or-clause) | – |
| `submission:submit` (create/resubmit + parent attachments) | – | – | – | ownChild | – |
| `submission:review` (return/accept + feedback) | any | school | ownSubject×Section | – | – |
| `submission:read` | any | school | ownSubject×Section | ownChild (own submissions/feedback) | – |

Notes:
- **`submission:submit` is parent-only** — admins do not fabricate a child's submission (no Student login; the Parent is the actor).
- **Download scope** (signed URLs): submission files reach admins, the owning teacher, and the linked parents — **never another parent** (R4).
- **Not built in M6** (later milestones): homework notifications (publish/feedback send none), un-review correction, standalone "notes".

### Report Cards & Academic Results (M7, ADR-014 — implemented)

Built as **M7** (see `docs/milestones/M7.md`). Lifecycle authority is **admin**
(`report_card:manage` — generate/edit/approve/publish/reopen/revoke/correct); the **class
teacher** authors a remark + submits under `report_card:remark`, narrowed by the `classTeacher`
scope (`assertClassTeacherOfEnrollment`, ADR-015) — a subject teacher of the same section is
refused; parents read own-child **PUBLISHED** cards. Row/ownership scope is enforced in the
service; RLS is defense-in-depth (10/10 read+write isolation proven).

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `report_card:manage` (generate/edit/approve/publish/reopen/revoke/correct) | any | school | – | – | – |
| `report_card:remark` (draft class-teacher remark + submit) | – | – | `classTeacher` (own section) | – | – |
| `report_card:read` | any | school | `classTeacher` (own section) | ownChild (PUBLISHED only) | – |

Notes:
- **`report_card:remark` is the class-teacher capability** — every TEACHER holds it, but the
  `assertClassTeacherOfEnrollment` scope refuses anyone who is not the section's class teacher.
- **Approve requires SUBMITTED** — approving a DRAFT (skip-state) is rejected, so every card
  passes the class-teacher review gate before approval.
- **Snapshot is frozen at APPROVE**; PUBLISHED cards are immutable — a fix is a **new version**
  (correct → publish, which supersedes the prior published one). Every publish/correction is audited.
- **Not built in M7** (later milestones): PDF rendering, report-card notifications, CGPA-across-years.

### Leave, communication (PRD-planned — NOT built)

> Numbering note: this project built **M5 = Examination**, **M6 = Homework** (above);
> the PRD's leave/communication plan shifts out. Tags left as-is pending an explicit
> renumbering decision.

| Permission | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `leave:apply` | – | – | – | ownChild | – |
| `leave:decide` | any | – | classTeacher | – | – |
| `leave:read` | any | school | classTeacher | ownChild (own applications) | – |
| `announcement:create:school` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `announcement:create:division` | any | school | classTeacher — **adopted v1.3** (Dev PRD §5/§8.8; client [CONFIRM §16.14] pending) | – | – |
| `announcement:read` | any | school | school | school (scoped to child's class/division + school-wide) | school |
| `message:create_thread` | any | – | own students' guardians | – (reply only) | – |
| `message:send` | any | – | own threads | own threads | – |
| `notification:manage_own` (list, markRead, register/deregister device) | self | self | self | self | self |

### Add-ons (feature-flag gated first, then permission)

| Permission | Flag | SA | OA | T | P | AC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fees:manage` (structures, invoices, reminders) | `fees` | any | – | – | – | school |
| `fees:view` | `fees` | any | school | – | ownChild (own invoices) | school |
| `fees:pay` | `fees` | – | – | – | ownChild | – |
| `timetable:manage` | `timetable` | any | school | – | – | – |
| `timetable:read` | `timetable` | any | school | ownDivision | ownChild | – |
| `analytics:view` | `analytics` | any | – (**decided v1.3**: Dev PRD §8.16 scopes dashboards to the principal; extend to OA later only if asked) | – | – | – |
| `flags:manage` | — | any | – | – | – | – |

## Student document visibility (M3)

RLS decides **who** can reach a student's documents (admin all; teacher = own-section students; parent = own children). The **business layer** (`StudentDocumentService`) then filters **which document types** are returned, by role — RLS is unchanged:

| `StudentDocumentType` | SUPER_ADMIN / OFFICE_ADMIN | TEACHER | PARENT (own child) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PHOTO` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `AADHAAR`, `PASSPORT`, `BIRTH_CERTIFICATE`, `TRANSFER_CERTIFICATE`, `MEDICAL_RECORD`, `OTHER` | ✓ | **hidden** | ✓ |

- Teachers see **only `PHOTO`**; every other type is hidden from teacher-facing APIs (list + get + signed-URL mint).
- **Never expose `MEDICAL_RECORD` to teachers.** If teachers ever need medical info, add a dedicated **Medical Summary** feature — not access to the uploaded files.
- Parents see all types for their **own** children only (RLS already limits reach).

## Enforcement invariants

1. Every add-on procedure checks `FeatureFlag` **before** permission; off → `FORBIDDEN` (ADR-006).
2. Repositories always scope by `schoolId` regardless of role (ADR-003/008) — `school` scope is belt-and-braces.
3. `status === ACTIVE` is enforced per request when the `Principal` is built (disabled users are revoked immediately).
4. Sensitive mutations (marks, attendance, users/roles, enrollment/promotion, money, leave decisions) write `AuditLog` in the same transaction (ADR-007).
5. Storage access is never direct: a tRPC procedure authorizes with this matrix, then mints a short-lived signed URL (ADR-004).
6. Every permission lands in `packages/constants/permissions.ts` in its milestone — this doc and that file must stay in lockstep (review checklist item).
