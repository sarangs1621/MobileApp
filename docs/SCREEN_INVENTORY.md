# Screen Inventory — School Management Portal

Every screen, keyed by the IDs used in `NAVIGATION_MAP.md` and `USER_FLOWS.md`. **MS** = milestone (code numbering: M1 auth, M2 people/academic, M3 attendance, M4 exams, M5 comms/leave, GL = go-live add-on). **States**: all list/detail screens implement loading (skeleton), empty (+CTA), error (+retry) per UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM §9; only extra states are noted.

## Cross-cutting screen requirements

1. Every screen: strings via `packages/i18n` (en+ml), WCAG AA, ≥44px targets, IST dates.
2. Tables degrade to card lists on mobile widths (UI_DESIGN_SYSTEM §9).
3. Signed-URL consumers (PDFs, attachments, photos) handle expiry by re-fetching, never caching URLs (ADR-004).
4. Flag-gated screens hidden when off; direct navigation shows a "not enabled" state (server returns FORBIDDEN).
5. Destructive actions (promote, drop, disable, reject, regenerate) use the confirm-dialog pattern naming the consequence.
6. **M8 (implemented):** the mobile **Home** (`(app)/index.tsx`) is now a scrollable role-aware dashboard —
   greeting + today-context (a teacher's sections / a parent's children) + permission-gated nav cards (F1/F7);
   the M0 placeholder is gone. Report-card / class-teacher / student-profile screens now render **names**
   (Staff.name + server-enriched exam/term/student/class/section names), not raw ids (F2–F5).
7. **M9 (implemented):** mobile **`(app)/timetable/index.tsx`** — read-only weekly timetable (teacher own
   slots / parent child's section, weekday-grouped, enriched DTO — no id lookups); the Home dashboard gains a
   **"Today's schedule"** card + Timetable nav, gated on `timetable:read`. Web timetable console = WEB-TT-01..03
   above (admin `timetable:manage`).
8. **M10 (implemented):** a notification bell + unread badge in the mobile home header and the web dashboard
   header (every role — `notification:manage_own`); MOB-NOT-01 / WEB-NOT-01 above are the inboxes. Tapping a
   notification marks it read and deep-links to the destination screen (by type — mobile routes are studentId-
   keyed, so it routes to the section, not the raw entity). Admins compose announcements on WEB-NOT-01.
9. **M11 (implemented):** persistent Announcements (MOB-ANN-01 / WEB-ANN-01) + School calendar (MOB-CAL-01 /
   WEB-CAL-01), gated on `announcement:read` / `calendar:read` in the home/dashboard nav. Announcement
   notifications now deep-link to `/announcements/:id` (the M10 inbox prefers the event `actionUrl`). Authoring:
   teachers draft (own sections), admins publish; web is the full console (attachment uploads, class/section
   targeting), mobile is lighter.
10. **M12 (implemented):** Student discipline (MOB-BEH-01 / WEB-BEH-01), gated on `behaviour:read`/`record`/`manage`
    in the home/dashboard nav. Teachers record from a student's profile (behaviour tab); admins run the web console
    (filters + resolve/close + CSV); parents view their child's history. BEHAVIOUR notifications deep-link to
    `/behaviour/:id`; LEAVE notifications deep-link to `/attendance/leave` (the M4 leave screens are reused — parent
    apply/history + admin approve/reject, which now auto-notifies the parent). The brief's leave/behaviour **calendar
    view is deferred** (M11 calendar covers calendar needs; not in the M12 DoD).
11. **M13 (implemented):** Fees & payments (MOB-FEE-01 / WEB-FEE-05..07), gated on `fee:read`/`fee:manage` +
    `payment:record`/`payment:read` in the home/dashboard nav. Admins run the web console (generate, issue, record,
    cancel, receipts, CSV) + manage structures; the office records payments (cash/UPI/cheque — **no online gateway**).
    **Parents are view-only** — ledger, outstanding dues and receipts (no "Pay Now" button). INVOICE_ISSUED /
    PAYMENT_RECEIVED notifications deep-link to `/fees/invoices/:id`. Receipts render on demand (print → PDF; no stored
    file). **Refunds + concessions deferred**; OVERDUE is compute-on-read.
